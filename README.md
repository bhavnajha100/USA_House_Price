USA House Price Analysis and Prediction

**Overview**

This project focuses on analyzing real estate market trends and building a predictive model for estimating house prices in the USA using machine learning techniques.
The goal is to understand the key factors that influence house prices and create a regression model that can predict prices accurately based on property attributes.

**Objectives**

Perform data cleaning and exploratory data analysis (EDA) on USA housing datasets
Identify important features affecting house prices such as location, square footage, number of bedrooms, and year built.
Develop a predictive model using Linear Regression (and optionally advanced models like Random Forest or XGBoost).
Evaluate model performance using standard regression metrics (R², MAE, RMSE).
Visualize insights to support data-driven decision making.

**Key Features**

End-to-end data science pipeline:
Data loading and preprocessing
Feature encoding and scaling
Model training and evaluation
Interactive visualizations for correlation, distribution, and price trends.
Modular, reusable Python code for scalability.

**Technologies Used**

Category	Tools / Libraries
Language	Python 3.x
Data Handling	pandas, numpy
Visualization	matplotlib, seaborn
Modeling	scikit-learn
Deployment (Optional)	Streamlit / Flask
Version Control	Git, GitHub

**Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**

Distribution of house prices
Correlation between features
Price trends based on location, bedrooms, and square footage
Detection and handling of outliers

**Model Training**

Models tested:
Linear Regression (Baseline model)
Random Forest Regressor (Optional improvement)
Metrics used:
Mean Absolute Error (MAE)
Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE)
R² Score

**Results**

Achieved R² ≈ 0.85 on test data using Linear Regression.
Feature importance shows square footage, location, and grade as major predictors.
Visualizations highlight strong linear patterns between price and key attributes.

**Dataset**
Source: Kaggle – House Sales in King County, USA
Description: Contains house sale prices for King County (includes Seattle).
Attributes: Price, bedrooms, bathrooms, sqft_living, grade, zipcode, etc.

**Learnings**

Improved understanding of data preprocessing and feature engineering.
Hands-on experience with Linear Regression and evaluation metrics.
Practical exposure to data visualization and model interpretability.

**Future Enhancements**

Implement advanced models (XGBoost, Gradient Boosting, Neural Networks).
Add geospatial analysis using latitude & longitude.
Deploy model as a web app with real-time predictions.
